patterns are based on the nested loops which is denoted by the no of columns and no of rows

so we should familiar with the loops and nested loops

steps 
1 : nested loops
    outer loops - rows
    inner loops - columns
2 : connect the columns to the rows with a logic

3 : print the required things in inner loops

4 : observe the symmetry between patterns (optional)
