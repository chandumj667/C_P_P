/*
    Find GCD of two numbers
    Problem Statement: Find gcd of two numbers.

    Examples:

    Example 1:
    Input: num1 = 4, num2 = 8
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Since 4 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.

    Example 2:
    Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 6
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Since 3 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.

    Brute Force:
        Traverse from 1 to min(a, b) and check if i is divisible by both a and b if so then store in a variable and repeat this process and get the max of it (i)
        then the number is the gcd of a, b
        Time complexity: O(N)
        space complexity: O(1)
    Optimal:
        using Euclideanâ€™s theorem by recursively until the b==0
        gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a%b);
        Time Complexity : O(Log min(a, b));
        Space Complexity : O(1);
