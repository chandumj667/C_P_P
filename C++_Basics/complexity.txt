complexity which is depend on the system based on the system we determine the time and space complexity 
as we code for a problem the amount of space the used data structure taking for the code and also amount of space taking and amount of time taking to execute the program.

basically we denote the complexity as Big Oh (O) - worst time complexity, Big Omega which is used to denote the average time complexity and Big Theta which is used to determine the least time complexity.

basically it depends on the no of iteration executed by the program
